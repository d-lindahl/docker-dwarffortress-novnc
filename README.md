# docker-dwarffortress-novnc
### Why
I wanted to run dwarf fortress on a headless server and be able to manage my dwarves via browser. There are already a few repositories dealing with this but they're either outdated or they lack dfhack. 

### Todo
- minify
- use newer ubuntu-distro
- parameterize
- proper wait for fluxbox
- try using the linux lnp
